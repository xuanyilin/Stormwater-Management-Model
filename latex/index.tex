The O\+W\+A-\/\+S\+W\+MM Open-\/\+Source Library is a hydraulic, hydrologic, and water quality analysis model, originally developed by U\+S\+E\+PA, written in C.

If you are interested in extending O\+W\+A-\/\+S\+W\+MM for academic, personal, or commercial use, then you\textquotesingle{}ve come to the right place. For community discussion and contributions you might have that could benefit a larger base of developers and users, please raise some issues over at \href{https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/Stormwater-Management-Model/issues}{\tt S\+W\+MM Issues}

We welcome discussion of all kinds! The O\+WA community of developers is excited to work with you! S\+E\+R\+I\+O\+U\+S\+L\+Y!!! If you like coding, join in on the discussions and share some ideas and code!

The O\+W\+A-\/\+S\+W\+MM project builds on top of the contributions put forward by Lew Rossman with his original work on delivering E\+P\+A-\/\+S\+W\+M\+M5. We are grateful for all the work that has been put into S\+W\+M\+M5 and we are committed to delivering advances to the engine in a community driven approach.
